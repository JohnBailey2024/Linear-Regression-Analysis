# Linear-Regression-Analysis

**Objective**: The primary aim is to craft a predictive model capable of accurately estimating individual
medical costs (charges) using multiple linear regression. This estimation will leverage predictors such as age, sex, BMI, number of
children, smoking status, and region of residence.

**Benefits**: This model stands to serve as a pivotal tool for health insurance companies, allowing them to
ascertain medical costs for individuals grounded on their health and demographic profile.
Model Utility:

**Insurance Companies**:
. Identification of key determinants influencing medical costs.
. Facilitation in the design of apt insurance plans for clientele.

**Individuals**:
. An accessible tool to forecast medical costs based on personal health and demographic
information

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Before delving into the intricacies of this predictive model, I visually explored the underlying
relationships and distributions among the predictors and medical costs through boxplots, a correlation
heatmap, and pairplots.

## Key Steps in the Regression Process

1. **Model Building**: Multiple linear regression models were constructed, taking into account the relationships between the selected features and the costs.

2. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the models was assessed using various metrics, such as R-squared, t-tests and f-tests, AIC and BIC.

3. **Feature Engineering**: We explored feature engineering techniques to improve the model's predictive power. This involved transforming, scaling, or deleting outlier features.

4. **Interpretation**: We analyzed the regression coefficients to understand the influence of each feature on the target variable. This step allowed me to derive actionable insights.

## Key Findings

- Confirming my research objectives, the selected model explains 82.6% of the variance in medical charges, highlighting particularly pronounced effects of smoking, age, and their interaction.
- Moreover, BMI and its interactions with smoking status and region also showcased important, albeit more nuanced, implications for predicting medical expenses.
- Insurance companies can leverage these insights to tailor insurance plans more adeptly, aligning premiums with individual risk profiles. Meanwhile, individual gain a tool to forecast prospective medical costs based on their health and demographic markers

## Conclusion

While this model provides a robust foundation for predicting medical charges, there are several avenues for future research. 
First, the dataset could be expanded to include additional variables, such as the type of insurance plan, the number of hospital visits, and the number of prescriptions. 
Second, the model could be extended to incorporate non-linear relationships between the predictors and response variable. 
Finally, the model could be applied to a larger dataset to assess its generalizability and
performance on unseen data
